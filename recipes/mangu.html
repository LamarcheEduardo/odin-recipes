    <h1>Los Tres Golpes</h1> 
    <img src="../img/mangu.jpeg">
    <p>Plantains for breakfast are usually eaten as mangú, which involves boiling the plantains and mashing them with some salt and oils or butter. It is traditionally served with fried eggs, fried cheese, and fried Dominican salami. The dish is then referred to as Los Tres Golpes (the three strikes).</p>

    <h2>What do you need to make Mangu?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 unripe plantain</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil, or butter</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Peeling</strong>:<br> Peel the plantains (see <a href="https://www.dominicancooking.com/30278-how-to-peel-plantains.html">how-to</a>) and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two. Remove the center where the seeds are located (optional, this is just my preference for a smoother mangú).</li>
        <li><strong>Boiling</strong>:<br>Boil the plantains in enough water to cover them plus an inch until they are very tender, having added the salt to the water before the water breaks the boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing</strong>:<br>Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps (be careful not to burn yourself). Mix in olive oil, and water at room temperature and keep mashing and mixing until it turns into a smooth puree.</li>
    </ol>
