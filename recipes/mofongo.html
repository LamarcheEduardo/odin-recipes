    <h1>Mofongo</h1> 
    <img src="../img/mofongo.jpeg">
    <p><em>Mofongo</em> is a dish with a special place in our hearts and stomachs. However, concedes Aunt Clara, the version we know best actually originates in the neighboring island of Puerto Rico. While there is also a Dominican mofongo, it was traditionally made with plantains roasted on coal (sources), as opposed to fried plantains. This was, therefore, different from the Puerto Rican mofongo we've now come to love.</p>

    <h2>What do you need to make Mofongo?</h2>
    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound beef bones, [0.45 kg] any type would do</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Peeling</strong>:<br> Peel the plantains (see <a href="https://www.dominicancooking.com/30278-how-to-peel-plantains.html">how-to</a>) and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two. Remove the center where the seeds are located (optional, this is just my preference for a smoother mang√∫).</li>
        <li><strong>Boiling</strong>:<br>Boil the plantains in enough water to cover them plus an inch until they are very tender, having added the salt to the water before the water breaks the boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing</strong>:<br>Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps (be careful not to burn yourself). Mix in olive oil, and water at room temperature and keep mashing and mixing until it turns into a smooth puree.</li>
    </ol>
